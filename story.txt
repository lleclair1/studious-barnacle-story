After the third world war, everything fell into chaos.
Governments collapsed, people revolted, billions killed.
Humanity is now on the brink of extinction.
A small group of survivors camps in the forest hoping that they can forge for enough food to last a few more days.
Max, ever the optimist, exclaims that there is a community of survivors "with food to spare!"
The others, not quite as convinced, decide to go along with his plan to find this camp.

Great story.

After hiking for weeks, the small group led by Max sees a pillar of smoke in the distance.
"See!? I knew it had to be here!" exclaimed Max.
Good news could not have come sooner. The group was out of food and almost out of water.
Apporaching the encampment, Max signaled that they were looking for shelter.
Although they were welcomed in, there is still much to be done to rebuild humanity.
