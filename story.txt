After the third world war, everything fell into chaos.
Governments collapsed, people revolted, billions killed.
Humanity is now on the brink of extinction.
A small group of survivors camps in the forest hoping that they can forge for enough food to last a few more days.
Max, ever the optimist, exclaims that there is a community of survivors "with food to spare!"
The others, not quite as convinced, decide to go along with his plan to find this camp.

However, there was no light and it was heavily raining.

After hiking for weeks, the small group led by Max sees a pillar of smoke in the distance.
"See!? I knew it had to be here!" exclaimed Max.
Good news could not have come sooner. The group was out of food and almost out of water.
Apporaching the encampment, Max signaled that they were looking for shelter.
Although they were welcomed in, there is still much to be done to rebuild humanity.

Walking into the camp, Max observed large massess of meat cookin over the fire and a blatant odor coming from the tents. 
Passing through the wooden gates, Max asked,"Do you guys have any extra food?
My people are starving and haven't had food or water in three days".
One of the camp guards  slowly walked towards Max and responded, "Our food is limited and we possess very few supplies,
however, our members have choosen an alternative lifestyle which has ultimately responsible for our surivival within this
post apocalypitic world". 
"What's the lifestyle?" Max asked. 
"Cannabilism" the guard replied."Now, dinner is almost ready would you want to join our group? or become our next meal?"

Max, being caught off guard, quickly grabbed his things and told the group to make a break for the outskirts
of the camp. They finally made it to the wooded area of the camp when a gunshot hit one of the groups survivors. After the
chaos it was found that one of the group's members was captured. Max had to make the decision on whether to leave Thomas or not.
